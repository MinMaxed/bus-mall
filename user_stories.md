As a marketing research team member, I:

1 Want customers to only see items they are most likely to purchase, so that they will commit to the purchase

2 Want to know how many of each product sells, so that I may adjust product orders to sell more in the 
future

3 Want to know how many times each product has been viewed, to know if that's a factor in poor sales

4 Want a comparison of views to clicks/purchases, to see which items should be the focus of marketing

5 Does not want user to see any of the data until they are done, as that the results doesn't affect their judgement 



As a developer research team member, I:

1 Want to make a Constructor to add items to a catalog, to easily add more items in the future

2 Want to cycle through 3 images each iteration that'll appear side-by-side-by-side, to simplify viewer experience
3 Want to limit User to a finite number of iterations, so that comparable data can be collected

4 Want to force the user to select an image in order to move onto the next iteration, so user choices are known

5 Want to provide MRT with data that's collected from each iteration, so that they know what the user's are doing/thinking



As a Focus Group Participant, I:

1 Do not want to see any immediate repeat selections, so that I see more overall options
2 Want to have a good selection of choices, so that I feel as though I have options
3 Want to have an exciting and consistent layout, so that I can quickly assess the next set of items
4 Want to know that my choices count, so that I feel as though my opinion matters
