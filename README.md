project description: 
Cycle various randomly generated images, 3 at a time, with no immediate repeats. After 25 cycles, the Results of the image's appears and votes will be displayed in a list form, as well as a colored chart at the bottom. 


3/21: 
Chart now displays in random colors, added a restart button


3/20:
Updated to include a Chart display, and made the Results more legible. 


3/19:
Results list are spaced out from each other and the edge of the screen, and will be displayed after the user has gone through 25 iterations, at which point the image rotations will stop. Counter is now improved and should function properly

3/19 Updates:
Got scaffolding set up, images cycling with no repeats then displaying results afterwards. got some help with Justin & Jason, and lots of advice from TAs. Worked with Jason & Stephan on for the wireframe.html which I only just afterwards realized should just be implemented into the index.html. Got to wireframe portion at the of the lab, having trouble merging it into index. Most of it should be carried over, but not all is displaying as I'd like. 

Have Temp coloring in css to help align sections. will be commented out for submission
